US Land use survey data will be filtered and analyzed to answer five simple questions. The data is 
from the United States Department of Agriculture’s report on major land use categories for US states. 
The report includes survey data from 1945 through 2012, taken roughly every 5 years.

1. Which region had the most "Grassland pasture and range" in 1974? Answer: Mountain total

2. How many states had at least 2,000 in the “Land in Urban areas” column for 
any year prior to 1987? Answer: 4

3. What is the average value of the “Cropland used for pasture” column 
among all states within the Pacific and Mountain regions for 1964? Answer: 777.1

4. Consider the original 13 colonies of England which became what is now the 
United States. Of the states that have land within the territory of those 
13 colonies, which state made the largest contribution to its region's total 
“Forest-use land” in 2012? Anwer: Georgia

5. Which region has had the largest shift in its land use between 1945 and 2012? 
Please explain your reasoning, including the data that you used to reach 
that conclusion. Answer: The region in which the land use changed the most between 
1945 and 2012 is Southeast total. The land type of Forest Use Land Not Grazed  
increased by 54100 acres.
