Simple data processing from csv file using Java

US Land use survey data will be filtered and analyzed to answer five simple questions. The data is 
from the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s report on major land use categories for US states. 
The report includes survey data from 1945 through 2012, taken roughly every 5 years.

This data analysis project is the technical challenge for the Ada Developers' Academy application 
for cohort 11.
